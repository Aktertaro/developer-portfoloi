            <h2>Things to know about Sushi</h2>
            <p>
                Sushi (すし, 寿司, 鮨, pronounced [sɯɕiꜜ] or [sɯꜜɕi]) is a traditional Japanese dish of prepared vinegared
                rice (鮨飯,
                sushi-meshi), usually with some sugar and salt, accompanying a variety of ingredients (ネタ, neta), such
                as seafood, often
                raw, and vegetables. Styles of sushi and its presentation vary widely, but the one key ingredient is
                "sushi rice", also
                referred to as shari (しゃり), or sumeshi (酢飯).[1]

                Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it can be prepared with brown rice or
                short-grain rice.
                It is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon, tuna or imitation crab
                meat. Many types
                of sushi are vegetarian. It is often served with pickled ginger (gari), wasabi, and soy sauce. Daikon
                radish or pickled
                daikon (takuan) are popular garnishes for the dish.

                Sushi is sometimes confused with sashimi, a related dish in Japanese cuisine that consists of thinly
                sliced raw fish or
                occasionally meat

                <h3 class="orange-colour">GUNMANKI</h3>
                <p>Gunkanmaki was invented at the sushi restaurant Ginza Kyubey in 1941. This invention enabled the use
                    of soft loose
                    ingredients as a sushi topping.
                    Gunkan means warship and the name of the dish is derived from the shape.
