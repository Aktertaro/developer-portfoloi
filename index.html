            <h3>The Way I Learn Japanese</h3>
            <p>ã€€My most interesting subject is Japanese, and I specially try to talk to japanese people to learn new
                things. At my part-time job, I
                communicate in Japanese and watch Japanese animation while studying to improve my Japanese skills in
                various
                ways. I usually communicate with school teachers in order to use correct Japanese, but sometimes I go
                out to
                play with my Japanese friends to learn more Japanese. By introducing the food of your own country and
                eating
                it together, or explaining the culture, you can practice what you are thinking in Japanese and deepen
                your
                ties with your friends.</p>
